Down the rabbit hole
![down we go](https://hacked.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rabbit-hole.jpg)
In this project, I rewrote the following pieces of redux functionality. Cleanup is still needed but it is a good start:
- [createStore](https://github.com/jmeline/react-examples/blob/master/redux-down-the-rabbit-hole/src/reducers/myRedux.js)
- [combineReducers](https://github.com/jmeline/react-examples/blob/master/redux-down-the-rabbit-hole/src/reducers/myCombineReducers.js)

I also wrote these helper functions that would reduce the traditional redux boiler plate:
- [actionCreator](https://github.com/jmeline/react-examples/blob/master/redux-down-the-rabbit-hole/src/reducers/myActionCreator.js)
- [reducerCreator](https://github.com/jmeline/react-examples/blob/master/redux-down-the-rabbit-hole/src/reducers/myReducerCreator.js)

Still need to deep dive into the following:
- middleware
- async action creator helper functions

I have been quite impressed with these resources that have helped in my personal understanding.
